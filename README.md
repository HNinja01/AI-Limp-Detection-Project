<p>The wearable limp detection device project explores how a small, low-cost, and programmable microcontroller like the BBC Micro:bit can be turned into a practical healthcare monitoring tool. The central idea is to design a system capable of detecting limping in real time by analysing how a person walks, using the motion data collected from the device’s accelerometer and using advanced machine learning. Limping is often a sign of underlying conditions such as leg injuries, post-surgical recovery issues, or neurological disorders. Having a tool that can automatically identify such gait irregularities can provide timely feedback to patients, caregivers, and doctors, allowing them to monitor recovery or spot problems before they worsen.</p>
<p></p>The project begins by attaching the Micro:bit securely to a person’s leg, commonly around the ankle or shin, so that it can capture walking movements accurately. As the user walks normally or with a limp, the accelerometer records acceleration along three axes, reflecting how the leg moves with each step. These recordings form a dataset that contains clear differences between normal walking and limping. By analysing these patterns, the system can be programmed to distinguish the two states. The approach is identifying irregular step timing or asymmetrical acceleration, or more advanced methods such as training a machine learning model to classify the data automatically.</p>
<p></p>The process of developing this device involves several key steps. First, motion data must be collected under controlled conditions, ensuring enough examples of both normal walking and limping. Then, the data is transferred to a computer or processed directly on the Micro: bit, where coding environments such as Python or MakeCode are used. Features like stride frequency, step rhythm, or acceleration asymmetry are analysed to capture the differences between walking styles. Once these features are identified, they are used to build a model or algorithm that can decide whether the current motion data corresponds to a limp or to normal walking. Finally, the Micro: bit can provide feedback to the user through its built-in LED display, auditory signals, or even by sending notifications to a connected smartphone.</p>
<p></p>Beyond its immediate function, the project carries several valuable educational and practical outcomes. It demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of modern technology by combining electronics, programming, health sciences, machine learning and data analysis into one project. From a practical perspective, it shows how affordable tools like the Micro:bit can be adapted for healthcare applications that usually require more expensive equipment. While the prototype may be simple, the idea can be extended with improvements such as integrating gyroscopes for more detailed motion capture, adding pressure sensors for footstep analysis, or training more advanced machine learning models for higher accuracy.</p>
<p></p>Ultimately, the wearable limp detection device illustrates how small-scale innovations can lead to impactful solutions. It takes a problem rooted in healthcare, frames it in a way that can be addressed with accessible hardware, and highlights the potential of AI and wearable technology to improve people’s lives. By transforming a microcontroller into a mobility-monitoring tool, the project bridges the gap between STEM education and real-world healthcare innovation</p>
